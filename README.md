# Morphology-Aware Tokenization for Low-Resource Language Modeling

This project studies morphology-aware tokenization for child-scale language modeling, with two tracks:


## Project Scope

The repository includes:
- A cleaned, reproducible pipeline to run Arabic segmentation experiments.

## Main Component

- **Arabic experimentation**
  - End-to-end Morfessor pipeline (`type`, `token`, `frequency`)
  - Intrinsic segmentation evaluation
  - Optional Morfessor vs Farasa comparison


## Goals

1. Build a fair Arabic tokenizer evaluation setup under low-resource constraints.
2. Compare morphology-aware tokenization against strong baselines.
3. Keep all experiments documented and reproducible.
